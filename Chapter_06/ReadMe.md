# Chapter 06 | Operators and Expressions #

Most line of code will contain *expressions.* A simple expression will be ` 2 + 4`. Any expression consist of two parts:-

* Operators 
* Operands

In the above expression, the Operators is `+`, and the operands are `2` and `4`.

## Operator ##

Here are some operators and there purpose are described below.

| Operator |              Purpose              |        Example         |
| :------: | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------: |
|    +     | Adds Operands                     |       2 + 3  = 5       |
|    -     | Subtracts Operands                |       2 - 3 = -1       |
|    *     | Multiply Operands                 |       2 * 3 = 6        |
|    **    | Power                             |       2 ** 3 = 8       |
|    /     | Divide Operands                   |        3/2 = 1         |
|    %     | Modulo Operands returns remainder |       13 % 3 = 1       |
|    <<    | left shift                        |       2 << 2 = 8       |
|    >>    | right shift                       |      11 >> 1 = 5       |
|    &     | Bit wise AND                      |       5 & 3 = 1        |
|    ^     | Bit wise XOR                      |       5 ^ 3 = 7        |
|    ~     | Bit wise invert                   |        ~5 = -6         |
|    <     | Less Than                         |     5 < 3 = false      |
|    >     | Greater Than                      |     5 > 3  = True      |
|    <=    | Less than or equal to             |     3 <= 4 = True      |
|    >=    | Greater than or equal to          |      4 > 3 = True      |
|    ==    | Equal to                          |     2 == 2 = True      |
|    !=    | not Equal to                      |     2 != 3 = True      |
|   not    | boolean NOT                       |    not True = False    |
|   and    | boolean AND                       | False and True = False |
|    or    | Boolean Or                        |  True or False = True  |


We can do math operation like shown in the table

````
5 + 6
````

But most of the time we are interested doing a math operation on a variable and then assigning the same to the variable. There is a shortcut in python for doing this like most of the programming language.

````
x = 1
x += 5
````

which means

````
x = 1
x = x + 5
````
