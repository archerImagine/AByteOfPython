## Comments ##

Comments are any text to the right of `#`. Few examples of comments are as below,

````
print "Hello World!"    #prints hello world.

#Print is a statement.
print "Hello World!"
````

Comments are necessary for coding because always remember, human memory is a bitch, so always comment your code, at least to find why you wrote the code.

Few important points which a comment can address:-

* explain assumptions.
* explain important decisions.
* explain important details.
* explain problem's you are trying to solve.
