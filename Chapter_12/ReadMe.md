# Chapter 12 | Object Oriented Programming #

## Introduction ##

We have written a lot of code till now, these codes were mostly data manipulation code, where every thing happened sequentially and by calling different functions from one or many function, this type of programming is called **Procedural Programming.**

There is another type of programming were we combine the data and the functionality into a single entity which we call as Class. This programming idea is called **Object Oriented Programming.**

There are two main aspect of **Object Oriented Programming**:

* **Class** : A **Class** creates new type.
* **Objects** : A **Objects** is **instances** of the class.

Two main components are involved in a Objects, which is a instance of a Class.

* **Fields**:- Variables which belongs to a class or object where we store data are called **Fields**. These are of two types.
    - **Instance Variables** : Variables which belongs to a particular object instances.
    - **Class Variables** : Variables which are shared across all the object instances.
* **Methods**:- Object can also have functionality in addition to storing data, The functionality is provided by the function within a object which is called **Methods.**
