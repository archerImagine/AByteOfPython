# Chapter 07 | Control Flow #

All the code we have seen till now are series of statements executed in a sequence. Python executes this in a top down order. But we know we want code or programs which can take decision on its own.

This decision can be as simple as printing "Good Morning" or "Good Evening", based on some criteria.

These are achieved by the help of **Flow Control Statements.** There are 3 type of flow control statements:-

1. `if`
2. `for`
3. `while`

## The `if` statement ##

The `if` statement is used to check a condition, if the condition is **true**, we run a block of code statement (called `if` block), else we process another block of statement (called `else` block).

The `else` clause is optional.
